# Audio Files Setup

For the medicine reminder system to work with sound notifications, you need to add an audio file:

1. Add a file named `alarm-sound.mp3` in this directory
2. The recommended length is 2-3 seconds
3. The file should be a simple, attention-grabbing sound
4. Ensure the file size is small (preferably under 100KB)

You can use any .mp3 file by:
1. Renaming it to `alarm-sound.mp3`
2. Placing it in this `/public` directory

Recommended sound types:
- Simple bell sound
- Short notification tone
- Gentle alarm sound

Note: If no sound file is present, the reminder system will still work with visual notifications.
